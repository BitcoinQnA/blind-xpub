# Blinding A Seed Phrase Using Massive BIP32 Paths

## Intro

Bitcoin's multisig security model is a breakthrough in human being's ability to self-custody value.
For example, it is impossible to `3-of-5` your gold.

A holder of a standard seed phrase used in a `4-of-7` multisig wallet may be able to learn substantial information about what they're protecting.
Having multiple seeds floating around that may convey information about what they're protecting introduces new risks and provides a choke-point for governments to gain access to information about private holdings.

While multisig offers unrivaled security to HODLers, one of the biggest barriers to adoption is the need for having multiple secure locations.
A scheme that enables 1 (or more) semi-trusted collaborative custodians (e.g. a lawyer, accountant, heir, close friend, "uncle Jim" bitcoiner, collaborative custody service, etc) to participate in a multisig quorum with *zero* knowledge of what they're protecting could increase multisig adoption and reduce hacks/theft/loss in the bitcoin space.

## Tech Overview

For this demo, we'll use [Specter-Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/) (powered by bitcoin core) as it's the de-facto standard for almost all new soverign multisig users today.
We'll also duplicate the code in [buidl](https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python) as it's a no-dependency bitcoin implementaiton written in python that is very easy to use.
For simplicity, we are going to blind just `1` seed phrase in a `1-of-2`, but it should be obvious how to expand this to a `2-of-3`, `3-of-5`, or other scheme.
At the end, we'll discuss implications for blinding up to `m` seed phrases.

## Buidl Setup for Verification (not required)
Easiest way
```
$ pip3 install buidl && python3
```

More secure way:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python.git && cd buidl-python && python3
```
(because `buidl` has no dependencies and is designed for simple airgap use, you don't need to install it)

Most of these verification steps can be performed with other open-source libraries, and we'll call out to them as well.

## Generate 2 Seed Phrases
Let’s assume that seed phrase A is held by (and generated by) me and seed B is held by (and generated by) a semi-trusted third party (e.g. a lawyer, accountant, heir, close friend, "uncle Jim" bitcoiner, collaborative custody service, etc).

### Seed Phrase A
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (invest repeated 12x):
invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) in SLIP132 encoding:
[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5mRMNhCLt7nNky1SpXzt1KdLb4FGKTTQuPxcG3MygnWyGTD87fYmK4tfyfgLahhb5SYanobvk1Zis676QSsGMjVQ9xz9QQcYsizJDq1xzxT

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) without SLIP132 encoding:
[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEZRP2dRKoGRJnR9zn6EoLouYKbYyjFsxywgG7wMQwCDVkwNvoLhcX1rTQipYajmTAF82kJoKDiNCgD4wUPahACE7n1trMSm7QS8B3S1fdy
```

### Seed Phrase B
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (sell repeated x12):
sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) in SLIP132 encoding:
[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5maJud3od8qgmvi3XPpnweRsBm4ir8QdVTesjtmt8Q3nV48HncG1sddZCMhr6W6GRoAs3svAXvGZ8GF98rQkHH5UMtCHJimTNNjNSWZUapk

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) without SLIP132 encoding:
[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEiNuxUt4pKjKk7khdv9jfcS92R1WQD6Z3dwjyMFrYj2iMrYbk3xB5kjg6kL4P8SoWsQHpd378RCTrM7fsw4chnJKhE2kfbfc4BCPkVh6g9
```

### Buidl Verification

This could be generated in build as follows:
```
$ python3
>>> from buidl.hd import HDPrivateKey
>>> HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("invest " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
'[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5mRMNhCLt7nNky1SpXzt1KdLb4FGKTTQuPxcG3MygnWyGTD87fYmK4tfyfgLahhb5SYanobvk1Zis676QSsGMjVQ9xz9QQcYsizJDq1xzxT'
>>> HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("sell " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
'[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5maJud3od8qgmvi3XPpnweRsBm4ir8QdVTesjtmt8Q3nV48HncG1sddZCMhr6W6GRoAs3svAXvGZ8GF98rQkHH5UMtCHJimTNNjNSWZUapk'
```

Note that we use SLIP132 version byte encoding to communicate unambiguously that we are P2WSH on testnet, but if you/your Coordinator software is smart then regular xpub/tpub can work great as well.
`buidl` supports any version byte, and [Jameson Lopp's convenient xpub converter](https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/) can also convert for you if needed.

## Blind 1 Seed Phrase

We blind seed B only using `buidl`'s built in [multiwallet.py](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1321503036724989952).
Remember that Seed Phrase B is held by our semi-trusted third party.

Important notes:
  - Do NOT share this record with the holder of the seed phrase, or they will be able to unblind their key (potentially leaking privacy info about what it controls).
  - Possession of this blinded xpub key record has privacy implications, but it CANNOT alone be used to sign bitcoin transactions.
  - Possession of the original seed phrase (used to create the original xpub key record), CANNOT alone be used to sign bitcoin transactions.
  - In order to spend from this blinded xpub, you must have BOTH the seed phrase AND the blinded xpub key record (which will be included in your account map before you can receive funds).
```

This looks better in the CLI app with nice colors:

### Verification

You can validate on this on an airgap computer using [Ian Coleman’s popular open-source tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) and [Jameson Lopp's xpub converter for SLIP132 version byte encoding](https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/).

[Here is a screenshot of proving accuracy of this derivation path](blinding_from_vpub.png).

For the avoidance of any doubt, [here is a screenshot assuming you have access to their seed phrase](blinding_from_seed_phrase.png) (SLIP132 version byte encoding [here](blinded_tpub_to_vpub.png)).

## Create Account Map

In our case, we take the regular seed phrase A xpub (see [Seed Phrase A](#Seed-Phrase-A) above) and the blinded Seed Phrase B xpub we just calculated (see [Blind 1 Seed Phrase](#Blind-1-Seed-Phrase) above) and combine them into a `1-of-2 p2wsh sortedmulti` using Specter-Desktop:
![image](1of2_p2wsh_sortedmulti.png)

That will also generate [this account map PDF backup](investx12_sellx12_blinded_backup.pdf) (account map only [here](account_map.png)).

### Buidl Verification

We run the following code in python:
```
from buidl.descriptor import P2WSHSortedMulti

quorum_m = 1
key_records = [
    {
        # investx12 - regular path
        "xfp": "aa917e75",
        "path": "m/48h/1h/0h/2h",
        "xpub_parent": "tpubDEZRP2dRKoGRJnR9zn6EoLouYKbYyjFsxywgG7wMQwCDVkwNvoLhcX1rTQipYajmTAF82kJoKDiNCgD4wUPahACE7n1trMSm7QS8B3S1fdy",
        "account_index": 0,
    },
    {
        # sellx12 - BLINDED path
        "xfp": "2553c4b8",
        "path": "m/48h/1h/0h/2h/2046266013/1945465733/1801020214/1402692941",

]
p2wsh_sortedmulti_obj = P2WSHSortedMulti(quorum_m, key_records)

## Get Receive Address

### Specter-Desktop

Powered by Bitcoin Core, we see the following address:
![image](address.png)

### Buidl Validation
```
>>> p2wsh_sortedmulti_obj.get_address(0)
'tb1q6d6frh07dl8djmnv48aqelp6r0mejzh7qgauw7yx5qcjehvcfnsqxc6lly'
```

Using a testnet faucet, we send some tBTC to this address:
<https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/67eed0727a639f214b3da3ee206b2a27ed8cd8aca6ccd795972da5bc33dc4d35>

## Sign Transaction Using Blinded Key
To spend from this multisig, only one seed (A or B) and the complete account map is required.

We will return the funds to the testnet faucet address:
`mkHS9ne12qx9pS9VojpwU5xtRd4T7X7ZUt`

### Specter-Desktop

Specter-Desktop creates an unsigned PSBT to sweep these funds:

## Why This Matters

At the time of seed generation up until revealing the account map (with secret BIP32 path), the holder of seed phrase B was unable to learn *anything* about what they were protecting:
* Transaction history (including any spent UTXOs) & balance
* Quorum information (`1-of-2` in this case)

We also establish a new [trust boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_boundary), explicitly separating privacy information (account map) from security information (private key material, in this case BIP39 seed phrases).

If the HODLer of this seed phrase were malicious or compelled by a government, they would not be able to reveal any privacy information.
Also, because this is built on top of existing BIP32 paths, it is *already* compatible with many existing hardware walelts an software libraries.

Of course, this scheme requires that the blinded key holder be able to get access to the account map in the event they are needed for recovery.
Presumably, this tradeoff is well worth it if the original key-holder is still alive but has lost a key and needs recovery assistance.
Alternatively, if the original key-holder is now deceased, privacy is likely no longer a top concern.

More on the mechanism of transfer of the account map is in the following section ([Bigger Picture](#Bigger-Picture)).

## Bigger Picture

In this scheme, we've used large and randomly generated BIP32 path to blind a single seed phrase in our quorum.
However, the same scheme could be applied to *every* seed phrase in our qourom.
This means that if an unauthorized party gains access to a single seed phrase (perhaps a single secure location is compromised), they learn *nothing* about what it protects nor what threshold is required for access.
Under current best-practices, if a bad actor gains unauthorized access to a single seed phrase they could perhaps learn the following:
* Yesterday that seed phrase was party to a massive transaction that likely had a large change ouput (note that this situation could be true even if this seed phrase did not cosign in the transaction)
* The transaction that this seed phrase was a party to (which likely had large change sent back to itself) was a `2-of-3`, meaning that only 1 more seed phrase (along with the account map) is needed to spend funds.

_Potential outcome: show up at this person's house or place of business with a $5 wrench._

If wallets self-blinded their own seed phrases, it would be possible for the Coordinator software to keep track of the account map, and split it using Shamir'S Secret Sharing Scheme.
It would then be possible to have something like a `3-of-5` on-chain p2wsh multisig, where perhaps `2-of-n` (where n is a large number and unrelated to the `3-of-5` in the on-chain multisig) Shamir Shards are needed to recover the account map.
If an unauthorized party gained access to a single seed phrase, they'd know nothing about what it protects.

A further version could have individual hardware wallets sign the account map before deleting the BIP32 path, so that when the account map is replayed they can know with certainty that they previously approved this account map (in the case of secure receive address validation for example).
A simpler scheme (similar to what BitBox02 already does) would be for the hardware wallet to store only a hash digest of the account map, and when a given account map is presented it would validate that this matches what was previously saved.
While simpler, the latter approach is difficult to transfer over to a new device should an existing device fail or be destroyed.

Even without blinding *all* seed phrases, this scheme still provides lots of value by allowing 1 seed phrase holder to participate 

### Compatibility

As of late May 2021, here is the compatibility of popular multisig hardware wallets:

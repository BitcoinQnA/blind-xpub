# Blinding A Seed Phrase Using BIP32 Paths

For this demo, we'll use [Specter-Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/) (powered by bitcoin core) as it's the de-facto standard for almost all soverign multisig users in 2021.
We'll also duplicate the code in [buidl](https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python) as it's a no-dependency bitcoin implementaiton written in python that is very easy to use.
For simplicity, we are going to blind just `1` seed phrase in a `1-of-2`, but it should be obvious how to expand this to a `2-of-3`, `3-of-5`, or other scheme.
At the end, we'll discuss implications for blinding up to `m` seed phrases.

## Buidl Setup for Verification (not required)
Easiest way
```
$ pip install buidl-python && python3
```

More secure way:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/buidl-bitcoin/buidl-python.git && cd buidl-python && python3
```
(because `buidl` has no dependencies and is designed for simple airgap use, you don't need to install it)

Most of these verification steps can be performed with other open-source libraries, and we'll call out to them as well.

## Generate 2 Seed Phrases
Let’s assume that seed phrase A is held by (and generated by) me and seed B is held by (and generated by) a semi-trusted third party (e.g. a lawyer, accountant, heir, close friend, "uncle Jim" bitcoiner, collaborative custody service, etc).

### Seed Phrase A
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (invest repeated 12x):
invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) in SLIP132 encoding:
[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5mRMNhCLt7nNky1SpXzt1KdLb4FGKTTQuPxcG3MygnWyGTD87fYmK4tfyfgLahhb5SYanobvk1Zis676QSsGMjVQ9xz9QQcYsizJDq1xzxT

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) without SLIP132 encoding:
[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEZRP2dRKoGRJnR9zn6EoLouYKbYyjFsxywgG7wMQwCDVkwNvoLhcX1rTQipYajmTAF82kJoKDiNCgD4wUPahACE7n1trMSm7QS8B3S1fdy
```

### Seed Phrase B
```
BIP39 Seed Phrase (sell repeated x12):
sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) in SLIP132 encoding:
[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5maJud3od8qgmvi3XPpnweRsBm4ir8QdVTesjtmt8Q3nV48HncG1sddZCMhr6W6GRoAs3svAXvGZ8GF98rQkHH5UMtCHJimTNNjNSWZUapk

Public Key Record (from hardware wallet) without SLIP132 encoding:
[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]tpubDEiNuxUt4pKjKk7khdv9jfcS92R1WQD6Z3dwjyMFrYj2iMrYbk3xB5kjg6kL4P8SoWsQHpd378RCTrM7fsw4chnJKhE2kfbfc4BCPkVh6g9
```

### Verification

This could be generated in build as follows:
```
$ python3
>>> from buidl.hd import HDPrivateKey
>>> HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("invest " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
'[aa917e75/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5mRMNhCLt7nNky1SpXzt1KdLb4FGKTTQuPxcG3MygnWyGTD87fYmK4tfyfgLahhb5SYanobvk1Zis676QSsGMjVQ9xz9QQcYsizJDq1xzxT'
>>> HDPrivateKey.from_mnemonic("sell " * 12, testnet=True).generate_p2wsh_key_record()
'[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h]Vpub5maJud3od8qgmvi3XPpnweRsBm4ir8QdVTesjtmt8Q3nV48HncG1sddZCMhr6W6GRoAs3svAXvGZ8GF98rQkHH5UMtCHJimTNNjNSWZUapk'
```

Note that we use SLIP132 version byte encoding to communicate unambiguously that we are P2WSH on testnet, but if you/your Coordinator software is smart then regular xpub/tpub can work great as well.
`buidl` supports any version byte, and [Jameson Lopp's convenient xpub converter](https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/) can also convert for you if needed.

## Blind 1 Seed Phrase

We blind seed B only using `buidl`'s built in [multiwallet.py](https://twitter.com/mflaxman/status/1321503036724989952).
Remember that Seed Phrase B is held by our semi-trusted third party.

Here is a blinded xpub key record to upload to your Coordinator.
Create a multisig wallet with this blinded xpub and it will become a part of your account map (output descriptors).

[2553c4b8/48h/1h/0h/2h/2046266013/1945465733/1801020214/1402692941]Vpub5uMrp2GYpnHN8BkjvXpP71TuZ8BDqu61PPcwEKSzE9Mcuow727mUJNsDsKdzAiupHXea5F7ZxD9SaSQvbr1hvpNjrijJQ2J46VQjc5yEcm8

Important notes:
  - Do NOT share this record with the holder of the seed phrase, or they will be able to unblind their key (potentially leaking privacy info about what it controls).
  - Possession of this blinded xpub key record has privacy implications, but it CANNOT alone be used to sign bitcoin transactions.
  - Possession of the original seed phrase (used to create the original xpub key record), CANNOT alone be used to sign bitcoin transactions.
  - In order to spend from this blinded xpub, you must have BOTH the seed phrase AND the blinded xpub key record (which will be included in your account map before you can receive funds).
```

This looks better in the CLI app with nice colors:

### Verification

You can validate on this on an airgap computer using [Ian Coleman’s popular open-source tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) (you may also need to use [Jameson Lopp's xpub converter for SLIP132 version byte encoding](https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/)).

[Here is a screenshot of that tool proving accuracy assuming you don't have access to your semi-trusted third party's seed phrase](blinding_from_vpub.png).

For the avoidance of any doubt, [here is a screenshot assuming you do have access to their seed phrase](https://gist.github.com/mflaxman/fd58e3385e60feb32a18fe79e3e9d2da/raw/0875fd6f14288d52689a045572dab4404d80bf27/blinding_from_seed_phrase.png) (SLIP132 version byte encoding [here](blinded_tpub_to_vpub.png).

## Create Account Map

In our case, we take the regular seed A xpub and the blinded seed B xpub and combine them into a 1-of-2 p2wsh sortedmulti:
